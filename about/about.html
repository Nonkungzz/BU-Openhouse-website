                Bangkok University is hosting an Open House, bringing together all faculties to help students who are unsure of which program or career path to pursue. The event features six key zones where participants can explore and learn more about themselves. Start at the <strong>PRO-CENTER</strong> to get to know yourself, move on to the <strong>CLUSTER CENTER</strong> to find your passion, and then visit <strong>PRO-ACTIVITIES</strong> to gain hands-on experience. You can also stop by <strong>PRO-CERTIFICATE</strong> to collect certificates for your portfolio, explore the <strong>FLAVORFUL FAIR</strong> to try dishes from professional food stalls, and end the day at <strong>FANCY NIGHT</strong> with fun and excitement. These zones are designed to guide students on their journey of self-discovery and career exploration.

After attending the Open House, students will leave with valuable knowledge and insights into different programs, as well as a Certificate for participating in activities and workshops. To top it all off, after a day filled with learning, students can enjoy a fun concert organized by the university seniors.
